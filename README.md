# Developer TASK [BLAZOR WASM] INTUS - Technical Challenge

 ## Delevery /Task Complete : 
Setup shortcut [Checked with different machine]It's Just to setup to all done Now.

    ## 1. Run the Setup.bat file (Will set up everything to run locally )
    ## 2. After Running just browse http://localhost:5000/ ( when in bat file command prompt showing Building...)
    
[It will ensure navigate & install dependency  for dotnet restore, installing dotnet ef ,add migration , update database , build & run the application with Provided Seed data .Just aloow the Setup.bat file sometime to do that , upto when it shows "Building..."]

 * Note : you will find the details below if you want to run development enviourment [Visual Studio 2022] 
 * Note : you will find the Navigation to application to say how to browse application sections & what they do
 * Note : to achieve better presentation I have deployed the application in Azure, You can browse it

     f.UI (BLAZOR ) is in seperate WASM implemented project

NOTE : Here BLAZOR WEB Assembly need API/INTERFACE to communicate/Feed data.It could have been a Seperated Pr 


# Technologies
 - BLAZOR WebAssembly
 - All project built on Latest .NET Core 6.0 
 - EF 6
 - Local DB [MS Sql Server]

# Good to share 
  - I have tried to have the best possible impression , thats why took time to polish & beutify
  - Tried to maintain n-tier Architecture along with Repository pattern.
  - Tried to maintain S O L I D
     - Interface are segragated
     - rather than a whole Scope tried to use one responsibility for single scope
     - ASP.NET Core Web API are to feed (to be honest not Restful in many ways)
  - I Could Have use Authentication/Authorization with Auth0 ( But seems it will be overdone/ not understanding the requierment like)
  - I Could Have to Use JWT Bearer to Autheticate & generate token (For best impression)
  - Uses Interface - Repository Pattern (Mixed N-tier)

# Prerequisites ( If some body want's to take the code in visual studio)

## Only [.NET Core 6.0 SDK] (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) has to be present to Run
## After running setup file , give it some time [after setting up npm-EF-Db-Seed data When it shows "Building" just browse http://localhost:5000/]

If you want to open in developer mode 

* [Visual Studio 2022] (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)

If you clone the repo, want to run the code in devlopment mode in visual studio

In Visual Studio 2022:

step 1 : clone the repository

step 2: have Prerequisites

step 3: open the solution file in visual studio 2022

step 4: go to command prompt terminal

step 5: run command to check ,  dotnet --version (it has to be ASP.NET Core 6.0)

step 6 : run command dotnet restore or clean the solution clean the project and  - build

step 7: make sure you setup the database and Entity Framework migrations!
This is how:
      1. Remove the contents of the folder Migrations.
      2. Then open the Package Manager Console (Tools->Nuget Package Manager->Package Manager Console).
      3. Run the following commands:

          Add-Migration Initial
          Update-Database
 
 
 step 12: run the solution [either with F5 or dotnet run ]

 step 13: Application should be in web browser
 
 
 # Navigation through the application
 


5) run the setup.bat file (you wil find it in current working directory)
   it does the below steps 

   - dotnet restore will restore all dependecis
   - dotnet build will build the project
   - check dotnet ef installed or not
    -if not will install globally
    - will create & update database according to migration
    - dotnet run will seed initial data 
    - application should be running in local IIS
